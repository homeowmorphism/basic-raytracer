# Basic raytracer

*Status: semi-polished.* (Code is functional and mostly clean but a couple things I'd like to improve). 

A basic Python raytracer. This Python raytracer was implemented to be easy to understand. It does not have many features and is not optimized for performance. The hope is that it can serve as a basis for understanding raytracers and help the user make a more intricate implementation in another language. 

## Features

* Diffuse light.

## Run

```
python display_scene.py
```
