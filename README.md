This Python raytracer was implemented to be easy to understand. It does not have many features and is not optimized for performance, but can hopefully serve as a basis and tool for prototyping for a more intricate implementation in another language. 

## Features

* Diffuse light.

## Run

```
python display_scene.py
```
