# Basic raytracer

*Status: semi-polished.*

This Python raytracer was implemented to be easy to understand. It does not have many features and is not optimized for performance. The hope is that it can serve as a basis for understanding raytracers and help the user make a more intricate implementation in another language. 

## Features

* Diffuse light.

## Run

```
python display_scene.py
```
